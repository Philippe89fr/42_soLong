## SoLong - 42

# Description:
So Long is a 2D game project that introduces fundamental game programming concepts using the MiniLibX graphics library. The player controls a character that must collect all items on a map and reach the exit using the shortest path possible. This project focuses on working with textures, sprites, window management, and event handling. The game features a top-down view with tile-based movement, where players navigate through maps defined by .ber files containing walls, collectibles, empty spaces, player starting position, and exit points.

Part of 42 Common Core.

## Map Example
```bash
1111111111111
1000001000001
10P0000000001
1000000100001
1000000000001
10000001M0C01
1000000000001
1000000000001
1000000000001
1000M00000001
100C00000E001
1000000000001
1111111111111
```
  - `1` represents a wall.
  - `0` represents an empty space.
  - `P` represents the character.
  - `C` represents a collectible
  - `M` represents a monster.
